# w7y.github.io
some kind of custom url shortener (like man i cant afford paying servers, 13 characters long website is good enough for me)

yo if ye need to shove up ur urls in the website post soming [here](https://github.com/w7y/w7y.github.io/discussions), the service is for free (if ur urls arent sus (at least to me))
